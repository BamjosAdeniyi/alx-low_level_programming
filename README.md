# alx-low_level_programming
A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides a minimal level of abstraction from the underlying hardware and is closely tied to the computer's architecture. Low-level languages offer direct control over hardware resources and typically have simple syntax and limited built-in abstractions.
Low-level programming languages offer advantages such as fine-grained control over hardware, efficient memory utilization, and high performance. However, they also come with challenges, including increased complexity, potential for errors, and a need for more manual memory management.

This repository is for ALX SWE programme Sprint 1, and the low level language learnt is C programming language.
